# typescript-project-example

This is the structure for a TypeScript project. It is using `jest` for testing and coverage, `eslint` as a code linter with recommended preset and `prettier` as code formatter.

This example is not using a task runner like `grunt` or `gulp`, instead of that, the necessary scripts were written in the file _package.json_ which is faster and smaller than install a task runner, plugins, read the documentation of the plugins before to be able to using them, etc.
